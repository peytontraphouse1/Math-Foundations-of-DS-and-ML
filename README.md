Code and notes from MATh 528 with Dr. Colebank (SPR2026)

Course Description:
"Data science and machine learning are revolutionizing the way we interpret, collect, and
analyze data. The implementation of machine learning methods is straightforward with
today's tools for coding. However, the mathematical foundations for these methods are
often overlooked or poorly understood. In this class, mathematical and statistical
foundations of machine learning methods will be covered. This will include reviews of
linear algebra, statistics, and probability. Fundamentals of optimization theory, supervise
and unsupervised learning, and function approximation will be covered. This class will
focus on both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of common
algorithms."
